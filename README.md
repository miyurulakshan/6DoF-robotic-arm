# 6DoF-robotic-arm
6 degree of freedom robotic arm with object identification and handling



To build a 6-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) robotic arm that can identify and handle objects based on their properties using a Raspberry Pi, follow these structured steps:
Components Required
Robotic Arm Kit: Ensure it includes servos (e.g., MG996R) and all necessary mechanical parts.
Raspberry Pi: Preferably Raspberry Pi 4 for better processing capabilities.
Camera Module: For object detection.
Power Supply: Adequate power source for servos (e.g., battery pack or DC power supply).
Jumper Wires: For connecting components.
Breadboard: Optional, for prototyping connections.
MicroSD Card: For Raspberry Pi OS and software.
Procedure
1. Design and Assembly
Kinematic Analysis: Before assembly, perform kinematic analysis to determine the optimal configuration of joints and linkages. This involves defining the range of motion for each joint and calculating inverse kinematics equations to achieve desired movements.
Assemble the Arm:
Unbox your robotic arm kit.
Assemble the base, attach the servo motors, and connect all mechanical parts according to the instructions provided with your kit. Ensure that each joint has a full range of motion.
2. Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
Install Raspberry Pi OS: Download and install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS on your MicroSD card.
Connect the Camera: Attach the camera module to the Raspberry Pi. This will be used for object detection.
Install Necessary Libraries:
Use Python as your programming language.
Install libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow Lite for object detection.
3. Programming Object Detection
Object Detection Setup:
Download a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model or train your own model based on specific objects you want to detect.
Use OpenCV to capture frames from the camera and feed them into your object detection model.
Sample Code Snippet:
python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load your TensorFlow Lite model
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Capture video from the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    # Preprocess frame for object detection
    # Run inference on the frame
    # Process results and visualize detections

4. Controlling the Robotic Arm
Servo Control:
Write code to control the servos based on detected objects. You can use PWM signals to adjust servo positions.
Force Control:
Implement feedback mechanisms (like pressure sensors) to adjust grip force based on the object's nature (fragile, heavy, etc.).
5. Testing and Calibration
Test the robotic arm's movements and ensure it can accurately pick up and place objects.
Calibrate the arm's movements based on real-time feedback from sensors or cameras.
6. Final Integration
Integrate all components into a cohesive system where object detection informs robotic actions in real time.
Additional Considerations
Ensure safety protocols are in place during testing to avoid damage or injury.
Consider using simulation software (like Gazebo or V-REP) for initial testing before real-world deployment.
By following these steps, you will create a functional 6DOF robotic arm capable of identifying and manipulating objects effectively using a Raspberry Pi as its controller.
